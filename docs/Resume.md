## Projects

### **Predicting Severity of Motor Vehicle Crashes in Maryland**  

- Built supervised classification models to predict motor vehicle crash severity (severe vs non-severe) using Maryland Open Data traffic crash records.
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on large-scale government datasets incorporating weather, roadway, lighting, and temporal factors.
- Trained and compared models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluated models using F1-score, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices to identify key contributors to severe crashes.

### **Mood-Based Movie Recommendation System**  

- Built an end-to-end Big Data ETL pipeline using HDFS, PySpark, and Hive to ingest, clean, and preprocess large-scale movie and user rating datasets (MovieLens and Netflix Prize).
- Applied NLP-based sentiment analysis using VADER (NLTK) to extract mood information from movie descriptions and enrich datasets with emotional context.
- Performed feature engineering with TF-IDF and implemented K-Means clustering to group movies by mood and thematic similarity.
- Developed a personalized recommendation system using ALS collaborative filtering (Spark MLlib) to predict user ratings and generate mood-aware recommendations.
